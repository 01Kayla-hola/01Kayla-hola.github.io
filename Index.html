    <h1>Computer Hardware</h1>
    <p>A computer consists of many different hardwares. Below are the common hardwares in a computer:</p>
    <div class="Topic 1"></div>
    <h2>1. CPU (Central Processing Unit) or Processor</h2>
    <p>CPU is used to interpret and execute commands in a computer by performing aritmetical calculation.</p>
    <h3>1.2 Intel CPU</h3>
    <p>Intel CPU has been around since 1968. Some people use Intel because of their preference, but now the performance is comparable with AMD.</p>
    <h3>1.2 AMD CPU</h3>
    <p>AMD entered CPU market in 1975. Before, the quality of AMD CPU was below Intel, but recently it has become better and even surpassed Intel in some aspect.</p>
    
    <div class="Topic 2"></div>
    <h2>2. RAM (Random Acess Memory)</h2>
    <p>The more RAM you have, the more apps you can run at the same time. The data inside RAM will be deleted when the app closes or the computer shut down.</p>
    
    <div class="Topic 3"</div></div>
    <h2>3. HDD (Hard Disk Drive)</h2>
    <p>The build of hard disk actually makes it unfriendly for mobile use, since the disk is sensitive to physical shock when being used, such as rotating or moving it too roughly. </p>
